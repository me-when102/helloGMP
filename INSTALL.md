# Getting Started: Getting helloGMP into Roblox Studio/Luau
You are not able to directly import the **helloGMP** library into Roblox studio, but you are able to build it manually into the engine.
The entire library is stored under the `src/` folder in the repo. 

## Building the Essentials
1. **Create a folder** under ReplicatedStorage and name it "**helloGMP**".
2. **Create two module scripts** under the `helloGMP` folder and name them as `hello_mpz` and `base_settings`.
3. **Copy the source code** from the corresponding files in the GitHub repo (`src/helloGMP/hello_mpz.lua` and `src/helloGMP/base_settings.lua`) into the ModuleScripts you just created in Roblox Studio.
