# Getting Started: Getting helloGMP into Roblox Studio/Luau
You are not able to directly import the **helloGMP** library into Roblox studio, but you are able to build it manually into the engine.
The entire library is stored under the `src/` folder in the repo. 

## 🧱 Building the Essentials

1. **Create a folder** under `ReplicatedStorage` and name it `helloGMP`.

    *Create the `helloGMP` folder inside ReplicatedStorage.*

2. **Create two ModuleScripts** inside the `helloGMP` folder and name them `hello_mpz` and `base_settings`.

    *Add two ModuleScripts named `hello_mpz` and `base_settings`.*

3. **Open the source files** on GitHub (`src/helloGMP/hello_mpz.lua` and `base_settings.lua`), select the entire code, then copy the code into the clipboard.
