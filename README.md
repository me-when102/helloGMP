# 🌟 The helloGMP Library 🌟
Welcome to **helloGMP**, your modular, high-performance library designed for use in Roblox Studio or Luau environments. **HelloGMP** is heavily inspired by the GNU Multiple Precision library (GMP), this library brings precision computation optimized for developers. 🔥🔥

[Install **helloGMP** here.](./INSTALL.md).

## Three Main Libraries
The library will have three main modules that specializes on different types of numbers:
- `hello_mpz`: Specializes on high-performance arbitrary precision integer arithmetic.
- `hello_mpq`: Specializes on rational number arithmetic that represents values as normalized fractions to avoid rounding error.
- `hello_mpf`: Specializes on float-point arithmetic with configurable precision and rounding modes for numerics that need controlled approximation.
Currently, `hello_mpz` is the only module that is functional, the two other modules are empty and their intentions might change.
