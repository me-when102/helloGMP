# 🌟 The helloGMP Library 🌟
This is an arbitrary precision library that is designed for full-digit computational precision in Luau/Roblox Studio, engineered to be optimized while correct.

It is heavily inspired by the GNU Multiple Precision library tuned for the Luau environment.

## Three Main Libraries
The library has three modules that specializes on different types of numbers:
- hello_mpz: The main core of the helloGMP library supporting big integers and calculation
- hello_mpq: Specializes on rational number calculations
- hello_mpf: Specializes on float-point calculations

For 1.0.0, hello_mpz is the only module that is functional, the two other modules are empty for now.
